# Jourminal
Curses for journaling within your terminal.
-
Urwid Docs: http://urwid.org/ (Curses lib), 
Arrow Docs: https://arrow.readthedocs.io/ (Date/time lib used, imo much better than datetime lib imo)

Use this for whatever you like, I would like to think I built a nice framework for the whole thing.
