# Journal-app
Python program for journaling within your terminal.
-
Urwid Docs: http://urwid.org/ (Terminal Manipulation), 
Arrow Docs: https://arrow.readthedocs.io/ (Date/time library used, imo much better than datetime lib)

Use this for whatever you like, I would like to think we built a nice framework for the whole thing.
